This is a test file.  It should hash to the same thing for the
verilog and the python implementations.

To hash it using python: python sha1_golden_brick.py inputfile

to hash it using verilog testbench, run t_sha1.v test bench in modelsim.  Result will be printed to
console in hex digest, just like python.

Compare.

They are the same.

Yay!
